## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khushalchandak17/auto_script_install.git
    ```

2. Make the installation scripts executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x auto_script_install/main.sh auto_script_install/data/*
    ```

3. Run the main installation script:

    ```bash
    ./auto_script_install/main.sh
    ```

This will clone the repository and make the necessary sub-scripts executable, allowing you to run the main installation script. Make sure to check the specific requirements and prerequisites for your project in the documentation.
